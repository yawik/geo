Geo Module
====

The Geo module provides a form-field of the type “Location”.
This form-field should be used whenever a Location is entered.
In the Core the type “location” is an alias to a standard form field type “text”.
So if the Geo module is inactive, a normal “text” field is used and nothing else happens.
